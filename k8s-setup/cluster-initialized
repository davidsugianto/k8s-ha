Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

You can now join any number of the control-plane node running the following command on each as root:

  kubeadm join 172.28.128.124:6443 --token qa6uzj.pcuqk42k23ighxo2 \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:be1749317db890206e75995bf14eb25716d4b39a2675cbda726961f64e208970 \
    --control-plane --certificate-key cce22a89308af42a34b88d5a0a596c223a2cae66ee8dab218167409b8cbeaf20

Please note that the certificate-key gives access to cluster sensitive data, keep it secret!
As a safeguard, uploaded-certs will be deleted in two hours; If necessary, you can use
"kubeadm init phase upload-certs --upload-certs" to reload certs afterward.

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

kubeadm join 172.28.128.124:6443 --token qa6uzj.pcuqk42k23ighxo2 \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:be1749317db890206e75995bf14eb25716d4b39a2675cbda726961f64e208970
